Inspiration
===========

     Minicraft was initially conceived as a Demake of Minecraft for Game Jolt's Indie Game Demake Contest.  Without Notch we would have never created this fun game!  We overcame the difficulties of losing a dimension in various ways and we tried to stay true to Minecraft throughout.  Enjoy our "8-bit" 2D version of the game!



What's Different
===========

     You can climb trees.  Trees and planks make good ladders, almost as good as ladders themselves!  This was neccessary so that you can get around the world in 2D.

How To Play
===========

     Watch your blue and red selectors.  They show where you will build or break blocks, respectively.  Crafting is very similar to Minecraft: put items into the crafting table to craft them. Right-click on the crafting table to open it and your inventory. The crafting templates are the same for the items we chose to put in.  Here are a few recipes to try.  Collect better matierals (wood->stone->iron->diamond) to create better tools.  Pickaxes are the only tools which can break stone.  Axes break wood tiles faster, and shovels break dirt, sand, and leaves very quickly.

w = wood
p = plank
x = sticks
s = stone
i = stone
d = diamond

[w _]
[_ _] --> p x 4


[p p]
[p p] --> crafting table

[p _]
[p _] ---> sticks x 4


[x _ x]
[x x x] ---> ladder x 4
[x _ x]

[w w w]
[_ x _] ---> wooden pickaxe
[_ x _]
